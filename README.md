# DSA-Java
This repo will walk through how data structures and algorithms can be solved in java
```bash
Time Complexity = time taken to run an algorithm
Space Complexity: the amount of memory taken to run an algorithm
Asymptotic analysis: gauges the performance of an algorithm based on its input size and rate of increase
(best case (lower bound)/fastest <= average case <= worse case (upper bound)/slowest
```
